		  		<p>Hi! I'm Jimmy and I currently live in the East Village in New York City. Originally I was born in Allentown, PA but I spent most of my life in either South Florida or Greenville, SC. When I was in the fourth grade I moved to Greenville, SC so I usually consider that where I grew up, but I've lived in a variety of places since. I graduated high school in 2005, and was incredibly confused about where I wanted my life to go and what I wanted to do. I was interested in technology but I mistakenly thought computer science meant IT Support back then, which I already did enough of for my family, so I never saw that as the path for me.</p>

		  		<p>This confusion led me down a couple different paths while I tried to find my passion. I spent most of my time in restaurants, everything from a manager at Shake Shack to a bartender at a brewery in Atlanta. It was when I was in Atlanta, where I lived before I moved to NYC, that I decided to finally finish my degree though I decided to major in Journalism and Marketing. Since I was younger I have always wanted to move to NYC and when I finally graduated with my degree I decided that's what was happening. I moved here with my boyfriend in March of 2019, and have been here ever since, thankfully in a larger apartment now!</p>

		  		<p>What brought me to Pace and a change in career has a lot to do with the pandemic. It was pretty difficult for me to find a job with my degree, as I didn't have any experience to put on my resume besides restaurants so unfortunately that's where I ended up. I have always enjoyed working in the hospitality industry but working in a restaurant during COVID completely drained my passion for restaurants. I knew where my strengths lie, and I knew I could do something else. So even though I never though I would return to school I saw the Pace masters program for Computer Science and knew I could take that education and turn it into a career.   </p>
